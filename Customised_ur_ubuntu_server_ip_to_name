I will like to teach how to customized your ubuntu ip to name in the URL
For example: http://192.168.*.*:8888 to http://gitlab.homeserver 

this will redirect your port to nginx port 80 

with the customized name its easy to remember your app rather than typing the server ip 

i will be using docker compose 

with this i will run the gitlab and nginx in dockerfile 

you are free to copy this dockerfile and edit to your own. 

start the docker file 

docker-compose up -d
